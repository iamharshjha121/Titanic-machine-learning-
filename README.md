# Titanic-machine-learning-
The file name of the project is titanic_problem_ml .
The project has been made entirely on jupyter notebook . 
We have been provided with 3 files , namely : gender_submission.csv , train.csv , test.csv . 
The file gender_submission.csv contained the details of the gender 
The file train.csv was of utmost importance to us , as it contained all the neccessary detail which we required to make the project .
We had been asked to predict if the arbitary passenger given in the test.csv file will survive or not based.
We can make this prediction on the basis of train.csv file , which helped me to train my algorithm to predict any arbitary passenger . 
we could have used naive bayes too , but since the accuracy of naive bayes is less , we opted to use Rain forest classifier .
Cheers :)
